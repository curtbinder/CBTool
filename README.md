CBTool - Generates Reef Angel Features File

This is a plugin that is loaded into the Arduino -> Tools menu. It processes the current
sketch file and generates the appropriate ReefAngel_Features.h file.

This tool/plugin is an addon to the default Arduino release. This functionality was
added into the custom Reef Angel Arduino build.

Installation:
* Make sure Arduino is closed / exited.
* Extract the ZIP file into the libraries/tools folder.
* Launch Arduino

Running:
With Arduino open and your sketch loaded, just select 'CB Detect Reef Angel Features'.
Once you run it, the status will update and tell you that you can Compile & Upload your code.
